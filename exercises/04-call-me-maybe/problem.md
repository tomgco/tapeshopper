# Call me maybe

Write a test for a function `repeatCallback(n, cb)`, that calls the callback `cb`
exactly `n` times.

As before the functions location will be provided through `process.argv[2]`.

## Hints

Sometimes we are not simply checking return values of functions. A lot in JavaScript
and node happens through callbacks and events. For this we often want to know:
Was that callback called or not?

The event-driven nature of JavaScript is also the reason why we had to call the 
`t.end()` function in the last level. The test has to know wether we are done.

However there is maybe a better way to do this with callbacks using `t.plan(n)`.
When we call this in the beginning we can tell `tape` how many assertions we are doing.

```js
  var test = require('tape')
  test('nextTick', function (t) {
    t.plan(1)
    process.nextTick(function () {
      t.pass('callback called')
    })
  })
```

In this example we only have one callback, which will simply pass the test when it 
is called. So we could have used `t.end()` within the callback instead. However you
might see, that if we had multiple callbacks in our tests the `t.plan(n)` would come 
in handy.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.`
