# tapeshopper
Learn how to test with tape! (tap-producing test harness for node)

Have a look at https://github.com/tomgco/tapeshopper/tree/master/exercises/helloworld for an example on how to write an exercise.

Install with `npm install tapeshopper -g` and run with `tapeshopper`.
This nodeschool workshopper is a work in progress.

For more information about nodeschool see here: http://nodeschool.io/

## Ideas:
- Teach about the exit code about the test in exercise 2 or 3
- travis-ci, appveyor (needs git-it knowledge)
- pretty printer (faucet, etc.)
- compare objects
- subtests
